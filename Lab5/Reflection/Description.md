Reflection in 2D Computer Graphics
Reflection is a geometric transformation that produces a mirror image of an object across a specified axis or line. In 2D graphics, reflection can be performed about the x-axis, y-axis, or any arbitrary line. Mathematically, it is achieved using transformation matrices that invert coordinates relative to the chosen axis.
- Reflection about x-axis: (x,y)\rightarrow (x,-y)
- Reflection about y-axis: (x,y)\rightarrow (-x,y)
- Reflection about line y=x: (x,y)\rightarrow (y,x)
This transformation is widely used in computer graphics for creating symmetrical designs, mirror effects, and geometric manipulations in 2D rendering
