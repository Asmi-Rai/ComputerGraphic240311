Rotation in 2D Computer Graphics
Rotation is a geometric transformation that turns an object about a fixed point (usually the origin) through a specified angle. In 2D graphics, rotation preserves the shape and size of the object but changes its orientation.
- Rotation by angle θ (counterclockwise about origin):
\left[ \begin{matrix}x'\\ y'\end{matrix}\right] =\left[ \begin{matrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{matrix}\right] \cdot \left[ \begin{matrix}x\\ y\end{matrix}\right] - Clockwise rotation: achieved by using -\theta .
Rotation is widely used in computer graphics for animating objects, changing viewpoints, and creating dynamic visual effects.

Would you like me to also prepare a quick reference table showing rotation matrices for common angles (90°, 180°, 270°)? That would make it easier to apply directly in your simulation work.
