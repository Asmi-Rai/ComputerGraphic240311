The midpoint ellipse algorithm is a computer graphics technique used to draw ellipses accurately and efficiently on raster displays. It works by dividing the ellipse into two regions based on slope and using decision parameters to determine the next pixel position. In the first region, where the slope of the curve is steep, the algorithm decides whether to move horizontally or diagonally, while in the second region, where the slope is shallow, it chooses between vertical and diagonal steps. By exploiting the symmetry of the ellipse, only one quadrant needs to be calculated, and the remaining points are mirrored across the axes. This approach minimizes computation, avoids floating‑point operations, and ensures smooth plotting, making it a widely used method in graphics programming.
